The customer data includes new customers, customers who have deleted their accounts, and customers who have updated their information (such as address, email, etc.). We will need to build our customer pipeline by implementing change data capture (CDC) for customer data using SCD Type 1 (Type 2 is outside the scope of this course).\n",
