    "### Estimated Duration: ~15-20 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll migrate a traditional ETL workflow to a pipeline for incremental data processing. You'll practice building streaming tables and materialized views using Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your Tasks:\n",
    "- Create a new Pipeline  \n",
    "- Convert traditional SQL ETL to declarative syntax for incremental processing \n",
    "- Configure pipeline settings  \n",
    "- Define data quality expectations  \n",
    "- Validate and run the pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Create a pipeline and execute it successfully using the new Lakeflow Pipeline Editor.\n",
    "- Modify and configure pipeline settings to align with specific data processing requirements.\n",
    "- Integrate data quality expectations into a pipeline and evaluate their effectiveness."

    "**NOTE:** The solution files can be found in the **4 - Lab Solution Project**. All code is in the one **ingest.sql** file:\n",
