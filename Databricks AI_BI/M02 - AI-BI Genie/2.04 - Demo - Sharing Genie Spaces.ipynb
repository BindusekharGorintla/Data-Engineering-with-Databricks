If you find other names, select one, and then take a note of the pulldown at right that allows you to define their permission levels.\n",

Where possible, assigning permissions to role-based groups is always preferable to assigning permissions to named individuals, because it means there is less maintenance work required on your part and greater security for your organization's data.\n",
