These abbreviations were in the training set for Genie's Large Language Model (LLM), but it just doesn't have enough context on our data to know to use them here. Give it some context by entering this into the chat window:\n",

    "\n",
    "10. Now ask Genie for a visualization: \n",
    "```\n",
    "Show me the distribution of opportunities by sales phase\n",
    "```\n",
    "What type of graph did Genie choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Ask explicitly for a bar chart.\n",
    "```\n",
    "give me a stacked bar chart showing that on a weekly basis\n",
    "```\n",
    "Did Genie figure out the temporal interval correctly?\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If your bar chart seems to have extremely thin and widely spaced vertical bars, it is because Genie chose to treat the X axis as covering a range of time rather than a series of per-week values. Click the pencil icon to edit the visualization; click on the **week** field, and change the scale type from continuous to categorical. Does the graph improve?\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Databricks is constantly improving the underlying large language model that Genie uses to develop responses, so it's possible that you won't receive any errors in your conversation with Genie based on the above example. Try prompting Genie with different queries to see how it responds. Did it respond as you expected or was there a misunderstanding of your question?"
