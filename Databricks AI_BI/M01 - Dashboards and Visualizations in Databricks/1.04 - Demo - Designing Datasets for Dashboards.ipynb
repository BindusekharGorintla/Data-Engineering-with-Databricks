This table identifies the relevant customer with a unique key that points into the **ca_customers** table, and it identifies the relevant product with a unique key that points into the **ca_products** table (which you'll create). The **ca_opportunities** table provides additional details regarding sales opportunities and sales representatives. You'll use the data in these tables to prepare your dashboard.\n"
