    "### B: Publish the dashboards and define permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "While permissions on your data are managed by Unity Catalog, permissions on AI/BI Dashboards are managed at the level of the SQL workspace. In Databricks, a workspace is a Databricks deployment in the cloud that functions as an environment for your team to access Databricks assets. This means that you must think about two different kinds of permission issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What Unity Catalog credentials will users use to access the dashboard's underlying data? And\n",
    "- What rights does each user have to the dashboard itself?\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem complex, but in practice there are a few common patterns, and we'll see the most common one in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your dashboard is complete, you can publish it and share it with others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Published dashboards can be shared with other users in your workspace and with users registered at the account level. That means that users registered to your Databricks account, even if they have not been assigned workspace access or compute resources, can be given access to your dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you publish a dashboard, the default setting is **Share data permission**. Share data permission in your published dashboard allows dashboard viewers to use your data permissions to access the data and power the queries that support it. This enables a shared cache, which can improve performance. If you choose **Individual data permission**, each viewer of the published dashboard uses their own data permissions to run queries. This can lead to more frequent refresh operations. If a viewer does not have access to the underlying data or the default SQL warehouse that powers the dashboard, _visualizations will not render._  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also notify viewers by sending emails to individuals or small groups when the dashboard is published.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Publishing a Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "To publish your dashboard, complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select **Dashboards** from the sidebar navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the dashboard selector, locate and click on the dashboard titled **Canada Sales** that is owned by you.\n",
    "1. Click **Publish** in the upper-right corner of your dashboard. Read the setting and notes in the **Publish** dialog.\n",
    "1. In the **Publish** dialog, you’ll see two data permission options. Make sure to select **Share data permission**.\n",
    "1. Optionally, you can notify viewers via email and describe your changes in the text field.\n",
    "1. Click **Publish** in the lower-right corner of the dialog. The **Sharing** dialog should open afterward. If it does not open, you can select **Share** next to **Publish** at the top of the dashboard.\n",
    "    - You can use the text field to search for individual users, or share the dashboard with a preconfigured group, like **Admins** or **All workspace users**. From this window, you can grant leveled privileges like **Can Manage** or **Can Edit**. See <a href=\"https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/auth-authz/access-control/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dashboard ACLs</a> for details on permissions.\n",
    "    - The bottom of the **Sharing** dialog controls view access. Use this setting to easily share with all account users.\n",
    "1.  Under **Sharing settings**, choose **Anyone in my account can view** from the drop-down. Then, close the **Sharing** dialog.\n",
    "1. Use the context icon at the top of the dashboard next to the dashboard name to switch between **Edit Draft** and **View Published** versions of your dashboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "**\uD83D\uDCCC Note:** When you edit your draft dashboard, viewers of the published dashboards do not see your changes until you republish. The published dashboard includes visualizations that are built on queries that can be refreshed as new data arrives. When dashboards are refreshed, they are updated with new data automatically; the dashboards do not need to be republished.\n",
    "\n",

This is suitable for comparatively less sensitive dashboards. For more sensitive information, where only a few named members of your organization should have access rather than everyone, the opposite pattern is common: \n",
