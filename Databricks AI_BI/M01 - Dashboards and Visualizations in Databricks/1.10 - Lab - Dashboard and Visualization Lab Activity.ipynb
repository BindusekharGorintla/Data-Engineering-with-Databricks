We should be able to use this table to look up information about our customers for our visualizations. For example, now we can report on all the customers who are in particular states.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. But what about the products? There does not seem to be a similar table that explicates each product ID in the same way that **au_customers** does for the customer IDs. In the real world, it is very common to need to enhance and augment data to get good visualizations, and that is exactly what we are going to do. Fortunately, in this example company, there are only 9 products, so we can quickly create a small table with more information about each.  _In this screen_, not in the Databricks user interface, click the small \"Play\" icon (the rightward-pointing triangle) at the top of the code block immediately below these words."

You can tell it explicitly what field to join on, as we did in our query description above.

    "1. Run your query and see if it works! You may need to adjust it. If there is an error, Assistant will display a \"Diagnose error\" button to inspect your SQL and offer a corrected query. Copy the new query back into the SQL editor panel, overwriting the previous attempt, and try to run it again. You might need to use the \"Diagnose error\" button more than once.\n",

To do so, you'll need to define a new dataset that joins the **opportunities** table to the **au_customers** table and then explore the data in the table. What fields are present? What visualizations might be interesting? Consider visualizations that compare the opportunities by sales phase and by sales rep."
