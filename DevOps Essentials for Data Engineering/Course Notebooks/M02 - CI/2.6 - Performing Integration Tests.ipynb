    "\n",
    "Integration tests for data engineering ensures that different components of the data pipeline, such as data ingestion, transformation, storage, and retrieval, work together seamlessly in a real-world environment. These tests validate the flow of data across systems, checking for issues like data consistency, format mismatches, and processing errors when components interact as expected.\n",

    "1. **Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipeline (Formerly DLT)**: With Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines, you can use expectations to check pipeline’s results.\n",
